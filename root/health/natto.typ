Natto has a bunch of K2 (1tbsp = 150mg K2). TODO fill out motivation more

= Tools

For this, I had a:

- Cotton towel
- #link("https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TMTJZ8L")[Instant pot pro plus]
- #link("https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0029T16VM")[bowl]
- #link("https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KYDZHSI")[steamer]

= Steps

This is specialized wrt portioning s.t. the result fits in my instant pot/bowl.

- Soak 500g soybeans in water overnight. Make sure there's ample water since the soybeans significantly increase in size
- Steam the beans for 1 hour (to preserve texture). Really put in as much water as possible without the water touching the steamer.
- Let beans cool to 105-109F (takes about an hour)
- Move natto to bowl
- Insert some existing natto that's been thawed in the fridge if frozen (I error on the cautious side and add a bunch of starter)
- Add 5tbps of the steamer liquid to the bowl for moistness
- Throughly mix to distribute natto
- Put cotton towel on top of bowl
- Put new, boiled water (I did RO-ed) water into pressure cooker
- Run "Yogurt mode" for 16.5 hours at 103F
- The result smells faintly of amonia, and is very stringy. It also really tastes and smells like natto.
- Refrigerate result for a few days, then freeze (optional)

= Cleaning

Ideally I would both clean and sanitize the equipment prior to the natto. Natto is basic not acidic, so it's a bit unusual in that sense. This makes sanitation more important (it seems that acidity kills bacteria).

However, I did neither clean nor sanitize and I got "lucky". Natto out competed any of the other growing organisms. I attribute this to using several tbps of natto (e.g. a LOT of starter).
