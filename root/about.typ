Hello! I'm a recent computer science graduate from MIT ('19 B.S. and '20 MEng).
I specialize in systems and devops and have an interest in formal methods.

My interests include:

- Distributed systems: topics like CRDTs (esp delta-CRDTs), state machine replication, and p2p communication
  are fascinating. Generally techniques to make something typically dependent on a central authority more
  decentralized are very interesting to me. Specific interests have included raft/paxos, HotStuff, and libp2p.
- Devops. I love controlling managing servers and deploying hermetic builds. My specific interests center around using Nix (the package manager, Linux distro, and DSL) to declaratively control my systems.
- Math:
  - Topics: probability, category theory, algebra
  - After taking #link("http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.856/current/")[6.856], I am constantly looking for places to sprinkle in randomness to improve algorithmic performance with high probability.
  - I am fascinated with the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence.
- All things low level. This includes embedded and osdev as well as clever optimizations to code (e.g. utilizing simd, cache locality, concurrency/parallelism, etc). #link("https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/")[6.172] imparted an awareness of low level things that's hard to ignore.

My career so far:

- RA at CSAIL (1 year)
- Researcher at Draper labs working on systems-ey things (2 years)
- Consensus/Networking engineer at #link("https://www.espressosys.com/")[Espresso Systems] (2 years)
- I enter the third year of my PHD in PL/Formal Methods this fall ('25) at Yale.
