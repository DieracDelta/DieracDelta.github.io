title: About
---

Hello! I'm a recent computer science graduate from MIT ('19 B.S. and '20 MEng).
I specialize in systems and devops. 

My systems interests include:

- All things low level. This includes embedded and osdev. My masters thesis
  was on osdev for embedded rust on riscv.
- Devops. I love controlling managing servers and deploying consistent builds. 
  My specific interests center around using Nix 
  (the package manager, OS, and deployment system) to get consistency.
- Distributed systems: things like CRDTs and raft/paxos, and generally techniques
  to make something typically dependent on a central server completely 
  decentralized are very interesting to me.


I'm currently working as Research Staff at Draper Laboratories on systems-ey 
things. Before Draper, I was an RA at CSAIL while I completed my masters at MIT.
