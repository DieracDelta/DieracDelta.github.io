Hello! I'm a recent computer science graduate from MIT ('19 B.S. and '20 MEng).
I specialize in systems and devops and have an interest in formal methods.

My interests include:

- Distributed systems: topics like CRDTs (esp delta-CRDTs), state machine replication, and p2p communication
  are fascinating. Generally techniques to make something typically dependent on a central server more 
  decentralized are very interesting to me. Specific interests have included raft/paxos, HotStuff, libp2p. 
- Devops. I love controlling managing servers and deploying consistent builds.
  My specific interests center around using Nix 
  (the package manager, Linux distro, and DSL) to declaratively control my systems.
- Math: probability and category theory. 
  I think the performance gains introduced with randomized algorithms are cool.
  I also am fascinated with the parallels between programming languages and category theory.
- All things low level. This includes embedded and osdev.


I'm currently working as a Systems Engineer at [Espresso Systems](https://www.espressosys.com/).
Before Espresso, I worked at Draper Laboratories on systems-ey things. Before Draper, I was an RA at CSAIL while I completed my masters.
